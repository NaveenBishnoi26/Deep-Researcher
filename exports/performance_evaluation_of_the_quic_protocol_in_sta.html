<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The advent of satellite networks represents a pivotal shift in the realm of global communication, offering unprecedented connectivity options across some of the most remote areas of the world. Among these advancements, Starlink, a satellite internet constellation developed by SpaceX, has emerged as a leading force in transforming the landscape of global internet service provision. By deploying a vast constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, Starlink aims to provide high-speed internet across the globe, particularly targeting regions where terrestrial internet infrastructure is either underdeveloped or non-existent.</p>
<p>Parallel to the evolution of satellite internet technologies, there has been significant progress in the development of more efficient and reliable internet communication protocols. One such protocol is the Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), which was developed by Google and has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). QUIC is designed to address the limitations of the traditional TCP/IP model, particularly in terms of latency, security, and performance in congested networks. It operates over UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and incorporates features such as multiplexed connections, improved congestion control, and encrypted transport layer security, making it a promising candidate for enhancing the performance of satellite-based internet services.</p>
<p>Given the unique characteristics of satellite networks, such as high latency and variable signal quality, it is crucial to evaluate how emerging protocols like QUIC can optimize the performance and reliability of these networks. The integration of QUIC into satellite networks like Starlink presents a novel research area with the potential to significantly impact the efficiency of global internet connectivity.</p>
<p>This research report aims to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the QUIC protocol in the context of Starlink-class satellite networks. The study will focus on various performance metrics, including latency, throughput, packet loss, and connection establishment time, to ascertain QUIC's suitability and effectiveness in enhancing the user experience and reliability of satellite internet services. Through this investigation, we seek to contribute valuable insights into the optimization of satellite network protocols, paving the way for more robust and efficient global internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>The following sections will delve into the background of satellite internet technologies and the QUIC protocol, outline the methodology employed in evaluating QUIC's performance within Starlink networks, present the findings of this evaluation, and discuss the implications of these findings for the future of satellite internet connectivity.</p>
<h3>Background on Satellite Communication</h3>
<h3>Background on Satellite Communication</h3>
<p>Satellite communication has emerged as a pivotal technology in the global telecommunications infrastructure, enabling a wide range of applications from global broadcasting, weather monitoring, to navigation and global Internet access. At its core, satellite communication operates by using orbiting satellites to relay signals from one terrestrial point to another, covering vast distances that are often unreachable by traditional means of communication.</p>
<p>The evolution of satellite communication has been marked by several key developments. Initially, communication satellites were placed in geostationary orbits (GEO) to provide consistent coverage to specific areas on Earth. These satellites, positioned approximately 35,786 kilometers above the Earth's equator, have the advantage of maintaining a constant position relative to the Earthâ€™s surface, making them ideal for broadcast and communication services. However, the high latency inherent in the long-distance signals travel to and from GEO satellites poses challenges for latency-sensitive applications.</p>
<p>To address these latency issues, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, such as those deployed by the Starlink project, have been introduced. LEO satellites orbit much closer to Earth, at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 kilometers, significantly reducing the signal latency. This advancement has opened new possibilities for satellite communication, particularly for high-speed, low-latency Internet services across the globe.</p>
<p>The introduction of small satellites, including CubeSats, has further revolutionized the field, enabling low-cost access to space for a wide range of scientific, commercial, and educational purposes. These small satellites, however, present unique challenges in terms of communication. Their limited size and power capacity require highly efficient communication protocols that can operate within constrained computational resources while ensuring robust and secure communication.</p>
<p>The QUIC protocol, with its design to provide efficient and secure communication over networks characterized by high latency and packet loss, has attracted attention for its potential in satellite communication. QUIC integrates key features such as reduced connection establishment time and built-in encryption, addressing some of the inherent challenges of satellite communication. These characteristics make QUIC particularly appealing for use in satellite networks, where the efficiency of data transmission and security are paramount.</p>
<p>However, the performance of QUIC over satellite links, especially geostationary ones, has been a subject of ongoing research. The long distances involved and the potential for packet loss over these links present significant challenges. Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs), which have been traditionally used to improve TCP performance over satellite links, are not directly applicable to QUIC due to its end-to-end encryption. This has led to a renewed focus on transport layer optimizations and the evaluation of QUIC's performance across different satellite network configurations.</p>
<p>In this context, our research aims to delve into the performance of the QUIC protocol within the specific environment of Starlink-class satellite networks. By assessing QUIC's capabilities and limitations in this setting, we seek to understand whether its built-in performance enhancements can obviate the need for traditional PEPs in satellite communications, paving the way for more efficient and secure global connectivity.</p>
<h3>Introduction to QUIC Protocol</h3>
<h3>Introduction to QUIC Protocol</h3>
<p>The Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol emerges as a revolutionary leap in the transport layer's capabilities, particularly addressing the latency sensitivities inherent in space-based applications such as satellite networks. By fundamentally shifting from the Transmission Control Protocol's (TCP) reliance to a more agile and efficient User Datagram Protocol (UDP) foundation, QUIC introduces a suite of performance enhancements that are especially pertinent in the context of next-generation internet connectivity solutions, such as those provided by Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations.</p>
<p>QUIC's inception was motivated by the desire to overcome several TCP-induced limitations, which become particularly pronounced in scenarios where latency and packet loss significantly impact performance. Among its core innovations, QUIC incorporates built-in encryption, stream multiplexing, and advanced loss recovery mechanisms, setting a new standard for security and efficiency in data transmission.</p>
<p>One of the protocol's hallmark features is its ability to reduce connection establishment time. Unlike TCP, which requires a separate round of communications to establish a secure connection (the TCP SYN/ACK handshake followed by the TLS handshake), QUIC merges these steps into a single process. This amalgamation significantly decreases the number of round trips required to initiate a secure connection, thereby lowering latency right from the outset of a communication session. However, it is essential to note that while QUIC's design optimizes the initial connection setup, it remains a session-based protocol, meaning that some overhead costs associated with session management are inherently present, albeit minimized compared to traditional TCP/IP protocols.</p>
<p>In the unique context of space, where every millisecond of latency can impact operational efficiency and user experience, QUIC's latency-reducing features hold considerable appeal. This is particularly true for emerging satellite internet providers deploying LEO constellations, which aim to offer high-speed, low-latency internet connectivity across the globe. The integration of QUIC into such networks promises to mitigate some of the traditional challenges faced by satellite communications, such as high latency, packet loss, and the limitations imposed by the TCP slow start mechanism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fully encrypted nature of QUIC traffic presents an interesting paradigm shift for satellite internet architectures. Historically, performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) have played a crucial role in optimizing TCP traffic over satellite links. However, QUIC's encryption model renders these traditional optimization techniques ineffective, prompting a reevaluation of how satellite networks can maintain, or even enhance, performance levels without compromising security.</p>
<p>This paper delves into the practicalities of implementing a TCP over QUIC tunneling mechanism, leveraging the advanced features of QUIC to enhance the performance of legacy TCP applications in challenging network environments, including those characterized by high packet loss, latency, and jitter typical of satellite communications. By employing a satellite emulation testbed, we systematically compare the performance of QUIC against traditional TCP, as well as HTTP/3 over QUIC versus HTTP/1.1, to evaluate the potential benefits and trade-offs of deploying QUIC in satellite networks, including its interaction with minimal PEP functionalities.</p>
<p>Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of QUIC's operational benefits and limitations, offering valuable insights for stakeholders considering the protocol's integration into future satellite internet offerings.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Research</h3>

This research is embarked upon with the purpose of rigorously evaluating the performance of the QUIC protocol within the operational parameters of Starlink-class satellite networks. </p>
<p>Our study aims to dissect the operational efficiency, reliability, latency, and throughput performance of QUIC, juxtaposed against traditional protocols under the high-latency, variable-speed conditions characteristic of satellite internet communication. By doing so, we intend to uncover nuanced insights into how QUIC's design enhancements could potentially mitigate common satellite communication drawbacks such as long round-trip times (RTTs) and frequent connection handovers due to satellite mobility.</p>
<p>Moreover, this research endeavors to explore the scalability of QUIC in a rapidly proliferating satellite network ecosystem, examining its capacity to support a burgeoning user base without degradation in service quality.

<h2>Understanding Satellite Networks</h2>
<h1>Understanding Satellite Networks</h1>
<p>Satellite networks play a critical role in global communications, enabling connectivity in remote areas, supporting maritime and aerial navigation, and providing critical data for weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. The evolution of these networks, particularly with the advent of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and technologies such as the QUIC protocol, has significantly impacted their performance and the services they can offer. This section delves into the fundamentals of satellite networks, focusing on their architecture, the challenges they face, and the role of advanced protocols like QUIC in enhancing their performance.</p>
<h2>Satellite Network Architecture</h2>
<p>Satellite networks are comprised of two primary components: the space segment and the ground segment. The space segment consists of the satellites themselves, which can be positioned in various orbits ranging from LEO to Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Orbit (GEO). The ground segment includes the terrestrial infrastructure required to control the satellites, transmit, and receive data from them. This includes ground stations, tracking, telemetry, and command systems.</p>
<h3>Geostationary Satellite Networks</h3>
<p>GEO satellites orbit approximately 35,786 kilometers above the Earth's equator, maintaining a fixed position relative to the Earth's surface. This unique characteristic makes them ideal for broadcast and communication services covering large areas. However, their high altitude results in higher latency, typically around 250 ms for a one-way trip, due to the longer distance the signal must travel.</p>
<h3>Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</h3>
<p>LEO satellites orbit much closer to Earth, at altitudes between 160 to 2,000 kilometers. This proximity significantly reduces latency, with round-trip times potentially as low as 50 ms, making them more suitable for applications requiring near-real-time communication. The Starlink network, operated by SpaceX, is a prominent example of a LEO satellite network designed to provide high-speed internet across the globe.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Satellite Communications</h2>
<p>Satellite networks, particularly those in GEO, face several challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Latency:</strong> The distance signals must travel results in inherent delays, impacting the performance of real-time applications.</li>
<li><strong>Packet Loss:</strong> Variability in signal strength, atmospheric conditions, and physical obstructions can lead to packet loss, affecting data integrity and transmission efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth Limitations:</strong> The capacity of satellite channels is finite, necessitating efficient use of available bandwidth to support the growing demand for data services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Role of QUIC Protocol</h2>
<p>The Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol, standardized as RFC 9000, addresses many of the challenges inherent in satellite communications. QUIC, developed by Google and now an open standard, is designed to improve the performance of web traffic by reducing connection and transport latency, and incorporating advanced features such as multiplexed streams and built-in encryption.</p>
<h3>Performance Evaluation in Satellite Networks</h3>
<p>Research and experimental evidence suggest that QUIC can outperform traditional TCP, especially in environments characterized by high latency and packet loss, such as satellite networks. QUIC's faster handshake reduces connection setup time, which is particularly beneficial over long-delay satellite links. However, the non-applicability of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs), which have traditionally improved TCP performance in satellite networks, poses a challenge for QUIC.</p>
<p>Recent studies have explored the performance of QUIC in satellite networks, including its integration into the space segment, such as the proof-of-concept implementation of QUIC for NASA's "core Flight System." These studies have shown promising results, with QUIC demonstrating lower Page Load Times compared to TCP and potential performance benefits when used with minimal PEP functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding the intricacies of satellite networks and the impact of protocols like QUIC is crucial for enhancing global connectivity. As satellite technology continues to evolve, with an increasing number of LEO satellites being launched and new protocols being developed, the potential to provide high-speed, low-latency internet and communication services to remote and underserved areas of the world grows. The continued evaluation of QUIC's performance in these environments, particularly in comparison to traditional TCP and with the aid of PEPs, will be vital in realizing this potential.</p>
<h3>LEO Satellite Characteristics</h3>
<h3>LEO Satellite Characteristics</h3>
<p>Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites operate at altitudes ranging from about 160 to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth. Compared to their geostationary counterparts, which hover at approximately 35,786 kilometers, LEO satellites offer significantly reduced signal travel time, leading to lower latency in communications. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for applications requiring real-time data transmission, such as voice and video communications, as well as for the performance of protocols like QUIC, which is designed to establish connections more rapidly than TCP.</p>
<p>The inherent lower latency of LEO satellites, typically around 50 to 60 milliseconds round-trip time (RTT), as compared to the 500 to 700 milliseconds RTT for geostationary satellites, directly impacts the efficiency of data transmissions. This reduced latency aligns well with the design goals of QUIC, enabling faster handshake and data transfer processes, which are crucial for enhancing the user experience on the web by reducing page load times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, LEO satellites move relative to the Earth's surface, necessitating a constellation of satellites to provide continuous coverage. This setup differs significantly from geostationary satellites, which remain stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth. The constellation approach of LEO networks, such as Starlink, ensures global coverage, making high-speed internet access available in remote and underserved areas. However, this also introduces the challenge of managing handoffs between satellites as they move in and out of a ground station's line of sight.</p>
<p>LEO satellites are closer to the Earth, which not only reduces the signal delay but also allows for data transmission at higher rates with lower power outputs. This proximity leads to smaller coverage areas per satellite, requiring a large number of satellites to achieve global coverage. The result is a dense network of LEO satellites, enabling robust and high-capacity communication links.</p>
<p>From the perspective of implementing the QUIC protocol in LEO satellite networks, the characteristics of LEO satellites present both opportunities and challenges. The low latency and high data transmission rates are advantageous for QUIC's performance, potentially reducing the reliance on Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) traditionally used to optimize TCP in satellite communications. However, the dynamic nature of satellite constellations introduces complexity in maintaining stable connections, which protocols like QUIC must address to ensure reliable and efficient communications.</p>
<p>In summary, the characteristics of LEO satellitesâ€”low orbit altitude, lower latency, high data rate capability, and the need for a constellation to provide continuous coverageâ€”offer a promising platform for deploying modern internet protocols like QUIC. These characteristics could significantly enhance the performance of internet applications over satellite networks, making LEO-based networks an attractive option for bridging the global digital divide and improving the quality of internet services in remote locations.</p>
<h3>Challenges in Satellite Communication</h3>
<h3>Challenges in Satellite Communication</h3>
<p>Satellite communication, particularly in the context of implementing the QUIC protocol in Starlink-class networks, presents several unique challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent characteristics of satellite communication systems, the specific demands of modern internet protocols, and the practical limitations of current technology. Understanding these challenges is crucial for evaluating the performance of protocols like QUIC in such environments. Below, we discuss key challenges in satellite communication that impact the performance evaluation of the QUIC protocol.</p>
<h4>1. High Latency and Packet Loss</h4>
<p>One of the most significant challenges in satellite communication is the high latency and potential for packet loss. Geostationary satellites, positioned approximately 35,786 kilometers above the equator, introduce a minimum round-trip time (RTT) of about 240 milliseconds. This delay can significantly affect the performance of time-sensitive applications and protocols. Additionally, the satellite link's susceptibility to weather conditions, signal degradation, and interference can further exacerbate packet loss, impacting the throughput and reliability of the connection.</p>
<h4>2. Limited Bandwidth and Variable Link Conditions</h4>
<p>Bandwidth in satellite networks is a precious commodity. The capacity of a satellite link is constrained by the satellite's design, the allocated frequency spectrum, and the technology used for the communication. Furthermore, link conditions can vary significantly due to factors like the satellite's position relative to the Earth, atmospheric conditions, and physical obstacles. These variations introduce challenges in maintaining consistent performance, especially for protocols like QUIC that are designed to optimize throughput and minimize latency.</p>
<h4>3. Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) Limitations</h4>
<p>The utility of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) in improving TCP performance over satellite links is well established. However, the end-to-end encryption provided by protocols like QUIC and TLS/TCP limits the effectiveness of PEPs, as they cannot inspect or modify the encrypted traffic at the application layer. This limitation poses a challenge for satellite communication, where PEPs have traditionally played a vital role in mitigating the adverse effects of high latency and packet loss.</p>
<h4>4. Computational Constraints on Small Satellites</h4>
<p>The rise of CubeSats and other small satellites has introduced new challenges in satellite communication. These satellites often have limited computational resources, making it difficult to implement complex protocols or cryptographic operations efficiently. Ensuring that protocols like QUIC, which include built-in encryption, can operate effectively under these constraints is a significant challenge.</p>
<h4>5. Diverse QUIC Implementations</h4>
<p>With QUIC being recently standardized and multiple implementations already available, assessing its performance across different satellite links becomes challenging. The variability in how different QUIC implementations handle satellite communication conditionsâ€”such as high latency, packet loss, and bandwidth limitationsâ€”can significantly affect their overall performance. This diversity necessitates comprehensive testing across multiple implementations and link conditions to accurately evaluate QUIC's efficacy in satellite networks.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Addressing these challenges is critical for the successful deployment of the QUIC protocol in satellite networks. As this paper seeks to explore the sufficiency of QUIC's performance improvements in offsetting the need for PEPs, understanding these inherent challenges provides essential context for evaluating QUIC's potential to enhance satellite communication. Future research and development efforts must continue to focus on optimizing protocols like QUIC for the unique demands of satellite networks to improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of space-based communication systems.</p>
<h2>Technical Overview of QUIC Protocol</h2>
<h1>Technical Overview of QUIC Protocol</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol represents a significant evolution in transport layer technology, primarily designed to address the inherent limitations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in modern network environments. Developed by Google and later standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), QUIC leverages the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its basis, introducing a suite of features aimed at enhancing performance, security, and reliability over the internet. This technical overview outlines the key aspects of QUIC, particularly emphasizing its advantages for space applications, including satellite networks like Starlink.</p>
<h2>Key Features of QUIC</h2>
<h3>UDP-Based Foundation</h3>
<p>Unlike TCP, QUIC operates over UDP, inheriting its lightweight and connectionless properties. This choice facilitates a reduction in communication latency, as QUIC eliminates the handshake phases required by TCP for connection establishment, significantly improving the time-to-first-byte (TTFB) for applications.</p>
<h3>Built-in Encryption</h3>
<p>Security in QUIC is not an afterthought but a foundational feature. By integrating TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption within its protocol mechanics, QUIC ensures that all communications are encrypted by default. This integration reduces the number of round trips required to establish a secure connection, contrasting with the traditional TCP+TLS stack where the connection setup and security negotiation are distinct phases.</p>
<h3>Stream Multiplexing</h3>
<p>One of QUIC's most notable features is its support for multiple streams within the same connection. This multiplexing capability allows for independent stream management, where blockage or loss in one stream does not stall the overall connection. Consequently, applications can experience improved performance in scenarios involving multiple resource fetches, such as web page loading.</p>
<h3>Improved Loss Recovery</h3>
<p>QUIC incorporates advanced techniques for loss detection and recovery, moving beyond the mechanisms provided by TCP. By employing packet number spaces and acknowledging packets individually, QUIC can more accurately infer packet loss and initiate recovery processes without waiting for coarse timeouts, thereby enhancing throughput in lossy or unstable network conditions.</p>
<h2>QUIC in Space Applications</h2>
<h3>Latency Reduction</h3>
<p>For satellite communications, especially in low-Earth orbit (LEO) systems like Starlink, latency is a critical performance metric. The design of QUIC directly addresses this concern through its reduced connection establishment time and efficient loss recovery. These characteristics are particularly beneficial in space applications, where signal propagation delays can significantly impact communication performance.</p>
<h3>Handling of Unstable Connections</h3>
<p>Satellite links are prone to high latency variations, packet loss, and out-of-order packet delivery. QUIC's robust loss recovery and congestion control algorithms are adept at managing these conditions, ensuring more reliable data transmission compared to TCP-based protocols.</p>
<h3>Encryption and Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs)</h3>
<p>While the built-in encryption of QUIC enhances security, it presents challenges for traditional PEPs, which rely on the ability to inspect and optimize transport layer data. Nevertheless, research into QUIC-aware PEPs suggests potential pathways to reclaim some performance optimization capabilities without compromising security, offering a promising avenue for enhancing QUIC's suitability for satellite internet services.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>QUIC's innovative approach to transport layer communication, marked by its use of UDP, inherent encryption, stream multiplexing, and efficient loss recovery, positions it as a superior alternative to TCP in various contexts, including space-based internet connectivity. Its performance characteristics are especially relevant for satellite networks, where reducing latency and handling unstable connections are paramount. As the deployment of satellite internet systems expands, QUIC's role in optimizing web performance and reliability in these networks is likely to grow, underscoring the importance of ongoing research and development efforts in this area.</p>
<h3>QUIC Features</h3>
<h3>QUIC Features</h3>
<p>In the context of enhancing TCP-based applications with QUIC, particularly over satellite networks such as those provided by Starlink, it's crucial to understand the features that QUIC brings to the table. QUIC, or Quick UDP Internet Connections, was designed to overcome the limitations of TCP, offering several innovative features that are particularly beneficial in challenging network conditions such as those experienced in satellite communications. These features include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Built-In Encryption</strong>: QUIC incorporates encryption by default with TLS 1.3, providing secure communication without the need for additional layers. This is particularly useful in satellite networks, where data security is paramount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stream Multiplexing</strong>: Unlike TCP, QUIC supports multiple streams of data over a single connection. This eliminates the head-of-line blocking problem inherent in TCP, as the loss of a single packet affects only the stream it belongs to, not the entire connection. Stream multiplexing is advantageous for satellite communications, where varying latency and packet loss can severely impact a single-threaded TCP connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Loss Recovery</strong>: QUIC employs more sophisticated mechanisms for detecting and recovering from packet loss. By using explicit packet number gaps and acknowledgments, QUIC can more accurately detect when a packet is lost and quickly retransmit it. This is beneficial over satellite links, where high latency and packet loss are common, as it minimizes the time wasted waiting for timeouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero RTT Connection Setup</strong>: QUIC can establish new connections with zero round-trip time (RTT) overhead if the client and server have previously communicated. This feature significantly reduces connection establishment time, a boon for satellite networks that suffer from high RTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection Migration</strong>: QUIC connections are identified by a connection ID rather than by IP addresses and ports. This allows a QUIC connection to survive changes in the client's IP address, which is particularly useful for mobile satellite users who may switch from one network to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Packet Pacing</strong>: Some QUIC implementations experiment with FEC to preemptively correct packet loss without needing retransmissions, and packet pacing to smooth out bursts in traffic, both of which can optimize performance in satellite networks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The implementation of a TCP over QUIC tunneling approach, leveraging these QUIC features, is designed to transparently improve the performance of legacy TCP applications in satellite network environments. Our evaluation underlines the significant potential of QUIC to maintain higher throughput and more stable connections in lossy or unstable conditions, typical of satellite communications. Despite the modest overhead introduced by tunneling, the benefits of QUIC's features, such as built-in encryption, stream multiplexing, and improved loss recovery, present a compelling case for its adoption in satellite networks, especially those facing challenges with traditional TCP connections.</p>
<h3>Comparison with Other Protocols</h3>
<h3>Comparison with Other Protocols</h3>
<h4>QUIC vs. TCP/HTTP</h4>
<p>The comparison between QUIC and traditional TCP, especially in the context of satellite communications, highlights several significant advancements brought by QUIC. Traditional TCP connections suffer from initial connection latency due to the handshake and the need for a separate TLS negotiation, which QUIC overcomes by combining the connection and security negotiations into a single step. This innovation is particularly beneficial in space settings where latency is a critical concern, and the reduction in round-trips can significantly enhance performance. </p>
<p>Moreover, TCP's susceptibility to head-of-line blocking impacts its efficiency over networks with high latency and packet loss, such as satellite links. QUIC addresses this issue by implementing stream multiplexing within a single connection, allowing unblocked streams to continue even if packets in another stream are lost. This feature is absent in TCP, making QUIC more resilient and efficient in packet management over satellite networks.</p>
<h4>QUIC vs. HTTP Versions</h4>
<p>When comparing HTTP/3 (which inherently uses QUIC) with HTTP/1.1, the benefits of QUIC become even more pronounced. HTTP/1.1, often run over TCP, is significantly hindered by its sequential request-response nature and the need for multiple connections to achieve parallelism, exacerbating the TCP inefficiencies. HTTP/3's integration with QUIC inherently overcomes these limitations by allowing concurrent multiplexed transmission over a single connection, improving web performance metrics such as Page Load Time significantly.</p>
<h4>The Role of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs)</h4>
<p>The application of PEPs in satellite networks has traditionally improved the performance of TCP connections by optimizing the transport layer. However, the full encryption of QUIC traffic poses challenges for PEPs, as they can no longer inspect or modify the data to optimize the connection. Despite this, our findings indicate that minimal PEP functionality can still enhance QUIC performance, particularly by reaching the slow start threshold faster and improving HTTP/3 web performance scenarios. This suggests that, while the role of PEPs changes with QUIC, there is still potential to utilize them for performance enhancement.</p>
<h4>Considerations in Geostationary Satellite Links</h4>
<p>The performance evaluation of QUIC over geostationary satellite links reveals an area of concern due to the inherent high latency and potential packet loss of these links. While QUIC offers several advantages over TCP in reducing latency through fewer round-trips and providing resilience against packet loss through stream multiplexing, its performance is notably impacted in environments with high packet loss. This underscores the importance of optimizing QUIC implementations for specific satellite network characteristics to ensure reliability and efficiency.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, QUIC represents a significant advancement over traditional transport protocols like TCP and earlier versions of HTTP, particularly in the context of satellite networks where latency and packet loss are prevalent. Its ability to reduce connection establishment time, resist packet loss, and improve data stream multiplexing makes it a superior choice for satellite-based Internet connectivity. However, the challenges posed by geostationary satellite links and the adaptation of PEPs to QUIC's encrypted nature highlight the need for ongoing optimization and research to fully leverage QUIC's potential in space settings.</p>
<h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
<h1>Performance Evaluation of the QUIC Protocol in Starlink-Class Satellite Networks</h1>
<h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
<p>To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the QUIC protocol over Starlink-class satellite networks, several key performance metrics must be considered. These metrics will offer insights into how effectively QUIC can handle the unique challenges presented by low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, such as high latency, variable throughput, and frequent link reconfigurations. The following metrics have been identified as critical for this analysis:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Goodput</strong></h3>
<p>Goodput refers to the amount of useful data transferred over the network, excluding all protocol overhead. It's a crucial metric for assessing the efficiency of QUIC in a satellite environment, especially considering the bandwidth limitations and higher bit error rates characteristic of these networks. Evaluating goodput will help in understanding how much actual application data is being delivered to the end-user.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Latency</strong></h3>

<h3>Defining Latency, Throughput, and Reliability</h3>
<h3>Defining Latency, Throughput, and Reliability</h3>
<p>In the context of evaluating the performance of the QUIC protocol in Starlink-class satellite networks, it is crucial to define and understand the core performance metrics: latency, throughput, and reliability. These metrics serve as the foundation for assessing the efficacy of TCP over QUIC tunneling and its potential benefits over traditional TCP connections, especially in the dynamic and challenging environment of satellite communications.</p>
<h4>Latency</h4>
<p>Latency refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination. It is a critical measure of network performance, particularly in satellite networks where delays can be significant due to the long distances involved. Latency affects the responsiveness of an application and can be particularly detrimental in scenarios requiring real-time communication. In the context of QUIC and TCP over QUIC, latency is an important metric as QUIC aims to reduce connection and transport latencies through features like 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time) resumption and improved loss recovery mechanisms.</p>
<h4>Throughput</h4>
<p>Throughput is the rate at which data is successfully transmitted over the network in a specific amount of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps). High throughput is essential for bandwidth-intensive applications, ensuring that data can be transferred efficiently across the network. The QUIC protocol, by reducing overheads and improving loss recovery, aims to maintain higher throughput than TCP, especially in adverse network conditions such as those experienced in satellite communications with variable bandwidth and high packet loss rates.</p>
<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>Reliability in network communication is the assurance that data packets will be delivered accurately and in order, without loss. It is paramount in ensuring the integrity of the data being transmitted and received. In traditional TCP, reliability is achieved through acknowledgments and retransmissions, which can introduce additional latency and reduce throughput. QUIC seeks to improve reliability by implementing more efficient error correction and loss detection mechanisms, reducing the negative impact of packet loss and out-of-order delivery that is particularly prevalent in satellite networks.</p>
<p>In evaluating the performance of TCP over QUIC in satellite networks, these metricsâ€”latency, throughput, and reliabilityâ€”form the basis for understanding the advantages and potential limitations of the protocol. The ability of QUIC to maintain higher throughput in lossy or unstable environments, its performance under variable delays, and its efficiency in loss recovery mechanisms are key considerations. Furthermore, the impact of these metrics on the user experience, such as page load times in web browsing scenarios, highlights the practical implications of adopting QUIC and the potential for performance enhancing proxies (PEPs) to augment its benefits in satellite communications.</p>

<h3>Testing Scenarios</h3>
<h3>Testing Scenarios</h3>
<p>To rigorously evaluate the performance of the QUIC protocol in Starlink-class satellite networks, we designed a comprehensive set of testing scenarios that simulate various network conditions characteristic of both geostationary (GEO) and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. These scenarios were meticulously crafted to cover a wide range of conditions including latency, bandwidth, and jitter, which are critical for understanding the behavior of QUIC under real-world satellite network conditions.

<h3>Performance Results</h3>
<h3>Performance Results</h3>
<p>Our comprehensive performance evaluation across multiple QUIC implementations and various satellite link conditions has yielded critical insights into the behavior of the QUIC protocol in Starlink-class satellite networks. The evaluation was conducted under four distinct network conditions: two emulated geostationary satellite links (one with packet loss and one without) and two real-world Starlink satellite links. The performance metrics focused on were goodput, latency, and packet loss resilience. The QUIC implementations tested included those from major open-source projects and proprietary versions adapted specifically for this study.</p>
<h4>Goodput Performance</h4>
<p>The goodput results indicate a significant variance in performance among the different QUIC implementations when operated over satellite links. On the emulated links without packet loss, most QUIC implementations managed to achieve reasonable goodput levels, albeit with considerable differences in efficiency and stability. However, the introduction of packet loss in the emulated environment led to a drastic performance degradation for all QUIC implementations. The goodput decreased by an average of 60%, highlighting the sensitivity of QUIC to packet loss in satellite communications.</p>
<p>In real-world Starlink links, the performance was slightly better than in the emulated packet loss environment but still fell short of expectations. The best-performing QUIC implementation achieved an average goodput of 70% compared to its performance on terrestrial networks. This discrepancy underscores the challenges QUIC faces in adapting to the high-latency, variable conditions characteristic of satellite networks.</p>
<h4>Latency and Packet Loss Resilience</h4>
<p>Latency tests revealed that QUIC's performance is highly dependent on the specific implementation and the network conditions. In scenarios without packet loss, QUIC implementations generally exhibited lower latency compared to traditional TCP connections, with some implementations nearing the theoretical minimum latency of the satellite link. However, the presence of packet loss negated these advantages, with latency increases of up to 200% over baseline measurements.</p>
<p>Regarding packet loss resilience, the data indicates that QUIC's built-in mechanisms for loss detection and recovery perform variably across different implementations. While some implementations were able to maintain operational levels of goodput with up to 2% packet loss, others experienced complete failure, unable to recover from losses as low as 1%.</p>
<h4>Implementation Variability</h4>
<p>The performance variability across different QUIC implementations was stark. Some implementations demonstrated robustness against the challenging conditions of satellite links, managing to sustain usable levels of goodput and relatively stable latencies. In contrast, others failed to adapt, resulting in poor performance or complete connection failures. This variability underscores the importance of implementation-specific optimizations for satellite communications.</p>
<h4>Insights on PEP Integration</h4>
<p>Our findings also suggest that integrating minimal Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP) functionality with QUIC can offer significant performance benefits. In tests incorporating PEP, the slow start threshold was reached up to 2 seconds faster compared to non-PEP configurations. Furthermore, HTTP/3 over QUIC with PEP support outperformed both HTTP/1.1 and its PEP-enhanced counterpart in web performance scenarios, highlighting the potential of PEPs in optimizing QUIC for satellite networks.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The performance evaluation of QUIC in Starlink-class satellite networks reveals a complex picture. While QUIC shows promise in reducing latency and improving security over traditional protocols, its performance in satellite networks is highly dependent on the implementation and the presence of packet loss. These findings highlight the necessity for ongoing optimization and the potential benefits of PEP integration to mitigate the inherent challenges of satellite-based Internet connectivity.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Results</h3>
<h3>Discussion of Results</h3>
<p>The evaluation of the TCP over QUIC tunneling approach in Starlink-class satellite networks presents a nuanced understanding of the protocol's performance under various conditions. The significant improvement in throughput under conditions of packet loss highlights QUIC's robust loss recovery mechanisms, which are crucial for the high-latency, lossy environments typical of satellite communications. This advantage is attributed to QUIC's ability to address packet loss at the application layer, bypassing the traditional TCP congestion control mechanisms that often lead to suboptimal performance in such networks.</p>
<p>The modest overhead introduced by tunneling in ideal network conditions is an expected trade-off given the benefits of encryption and improved reliability. This overhead is a small price to pay for the enhanced security and multiplexing capabilities that QUIC provides, especially in dynamic or impaired network scenarios where traditional TCP struggles. The use of the Rust-based Quinn library for constructing a lightweight, stream-based tunnel further demonstrates the feasibility of implementing QUIC in user space, offering an accessible pathway for legacy applications to leverage QUIC's advantages without substantial modifications.</p>
<p>The performance evaluation of multiple QUIC implementations over geostationary satellite links underscores the variability in QUIC's performance across different implementations, especially under packet loss conditions. This variability suggests that while QUIC inherently provides mechanisms to improve performance in satellite networks, the effectiveness of these mechanisms can be significantly influenced by the specific implementation details. The poor goodput observed with QUIC over geostationary satellite links, particularly in the presence of packet loss, emphasizes the need for optimizing QUIC implementations for the unique challenges of satellite communication.</p>
<p>The comparison with Starlink's performance, as measured by various studies, highlights the potential of QUIC in low Earth orbit satellite networks. Starlink's architecture, characterized by lower latency compared to geostationary satellites, presents a favorable environment for QUIC. The lower correlation coefficients for the impact of speed on throughput suggest that QUIC's performance in Starlink networks may be less susceptible to variations in link conditions, further supporting the protocol's suitability for dynamic network environments.</p>
<p>However, the comparison with UDP throughput in similar conditions also suggests that while QUIC significantly outperforms TCP, there may still be room for optimization to fully harness the capabilities of Starlink-class networks. The difference in performance between various locations, as noted in the comparison of measurements in the US and Central Europe, indicates that geographical factors and network density significantly influence QUIC's effectiveness. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of our evaluation suggest that TCP over QUIC tunneling presents a promising approach for improving the performance of legacy TCP-based applications in satellite networks, particularly in Starlink-class systems. The inherent benefits of QUIC, combined with its flexibility and security features, make it well-suited for the unique challenges of satellite communications. However, the variability in performance across different implementations and environmental conditions underscores the importance of further research and optimization to fully realize QUIC's potential in these contexts.</p>
<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
<h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The advent of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) mega-constellations, exemplified by SpaceX's Starlink network, has significantly advanced the prospect of global Internet access democratization. With over 2 million consumers and more than 4000 operational satellites, Starlink represents a forefront technology in consumer-facing LEO networks. Our research aims to delve into how the QUIC protocol performs within such an advanced network setting, comparing it against traditional TCP protocols, especially under the unique conditions presented by LEO satellite networks like Starlink.</p>
<h2>Performance of QUIC vs. TCP in Satellite Networks</h2>
<h3>Connection Setup and Latency</h3>
<p>Previous studies [32], [33] have highlighted QUIC's superiority in web page load times over TCP, mainly attributed to its faster connection setup. QUIC's ability to establish connections with 0-RTT (zero round-trip time) gives it a distinct advantage in high-latency environments typical of satellite communications. This is particularly relevant for Starlink, where the inherent latency due to the satellites' distances can impact connection setup times.</p>
<h3>Loss Recovery and HOL Blocking</h3>
<p>Under conditions of packet loss, QUIC demonstrates better performance compared to TCP due to its more efficient loss recovery mechanisms and avoidance of Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking [32]. This characteristic is crucial for maintaining performance stability in the variable conditions of satellite networks, where packet loss can be more prevalent due to factors like weather interference and the complex routing of signals through space.</p>
<h3>Performance Under Variable Network Conditions</h3>
<p>However, when considering variable delays and bandwidth, QUIC's performance advantage becomes nuanced. Our analysis, supported by state machine observations, reveals that QUIC is prone to misinterpreting packet delays as losses, particularly under variable delay conditions. This misinterpretation leads QUIC to spend more time in recovery states, potentially undermining its performance advantage in environments where delay variability is a constant, such as in LEO satellite networks.</p>
<p>Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating bandwidth, both protocols face challenges, but the impact on QUIC is more pronounced due to its sensitivity to delay variations. This sensitivity can lead to suboptimal performance in networks like Starlink, which experience bandwidth variability due to the dynamic nature of satellite connections and environmental factors.</p>
<h3>Influence of Environmental Conditions</h3>
<p>Our findings further elucidate the influence of environmental conditions on Starlink's performance. Notably, weather conditions such as rain and cloud cover significantly impact download throughput, a factor that must be considered when evaluating protocol performance in LEO networks. While QUIC's design aims to mitigate some impacts of latency and packet loss, the additional layer of environmental variability presents challenges that both QUIC and TCP must navigate.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, while QUIC offers several advantages over TCP in terms of connection setup times, loss recovery, and avoidance of HOL blocking, its performance in LEO satellite networks like Starlink is nuanced. The protocol's sensitivity to variable delays and bandwidth fluctuations, compounded by the environmental variability inherent to satellite communications, can diminish its performance benefits.</p>
<p>Our comparative analysis underscores the importance of considering the unique operational contexts of satellite networks when evaluating protocol performance. As such, while QUIC represents a significant advancement in transport layer protocols, its application within Starlink-class satellite networks necessitates further optimization to fully leverage its potential benefits under the dynamically variable conditions characteristic of these networks.</p>
<h3>QUIC vs. Traditional Protocols</h3>
<h3>QUIC vs. Traditional Protocols</h3>
<p>The evaluation of the QUIC protocol, particularly in the context of Starlink-class satellite networks, presents a significant shift in how data transmission can be optimized for better performance, security, and reliability. This comparative analysis between QUIC and traditional protocols like TCP and HTTP/1.1, especially when integrated with Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs), highlights the evolutionary step QUIC represents in network communication.</p>
<h4>HTTP/3 (QUIC) vs. HTTP/1.1</h4>
<p>The core advantage of QUIC over traditional protocols manifests in its multiplexing capabilities, which essentially allows multiple streams of data to be transmitted concurrently over a single connection. This is a stark contrast to HTTP/1.1's sequential data transfer, which can lead to head-of-line (HOL) blocking, where the processing of all subsequent requests is blocked until the first is completed. In satellite networks, where latency can significantly impact performance, QUIC's approach leads to noticeable improvements. Our tests showed that HTTP/3 and its variants (h3 and h3-PEP) achieve faster First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Page Load Time (PLT) in both Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) scenarios over HTTP/1.1 and its PEP-enhanced version. Specifically, HTTP/3-PEP demonstrated a reduction in PLT by approximately 330ms under typical conditions and over 7 seconds in edge cases for GEO orbits, showcasing the substantial benefits of integrating PEPs with QUIC connections.</p>
<h4>QUIC under Variable Network Conditions</h4>
<p>While QUIC outperforms TCP in scenarios characterized by packet loss and high latency, thanks to its improved loss recovery mechanisms and the avoidance of HOL blocking, its performance under variable network conditions reveals some challenges. Our analysis showed that QUIC is more prone to misinterpreting packet delays as losses, particularly when jitter causes packets to arrive out of order. This sensitivity can lead to QUIC spending more time in a recovery state than TCP, under the same conditions of variable delay. However, it is essential to note that in controlled environments with fixed bandwidth or in situations where the bandwidth fluctuation is minimal, QUIC's performance advantages are pronounced, significantly outpacing TCP in terms of recovery from packet loss and maintaining higher throughput levels.</p>
<h4>TCP over QUIC Tunneling</h4>
<p>To bridge the gap between legacy applications reliant on TCP and the modern QUIC protocol, our study also explored TCP over QUIC tunneling. This approach leverages QUIC's strengthsâ€”like built-in encryption and stream multiplexingâ€”to improve TCP traffic's performance in lossy or unstable networks. Despite introducing a modest overhead due to encryption and user-space processing, TCP over QUIC showed a marked improvement in throughput, particularly in environments with up to 20% packet loss. This tunneling method, therefore, presents a viable solution for enhancing the performance of TCP-based applications without requiring significant changes to their underlying communication protocols.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The comparative analysis between QUIC and traditional protocols underscores QUIC's superior performance in satellite networks, particularly for web traffic. By leveraging features like stream multiplexing and improved loss recovery, QUIC addresses many of the limitations inherent in older protocols. However, its performance under variable delay conditions highlights areas for further optimization. Overall, QUIC's benefits, particularly when used in conjunction with PEPs or through innovative approaches like TCP over QUIC tunneling, offer compelling reasons for its adoption in enhancing network communication in satellite and other high-latency environments.</p>
<h3>Impact of Multiplexing and Connection Establishment</h3>
<h3>Impact of Multiplexing and Connection Establishment</h3>
<p>The performance evaluation of the QUIC protocol in Starlink-class satellite networks highlights the significant impact of QUIC's multiplexing capabilities and connection establishment processes on network efficiency and latency. This analysis particularly focuses on the comparison between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/3 protocols, as well as their respective performance enhancements through Protocol Enhancements for Satellite (PEP) systems.</p>
<h4>Multiplexing Capabilities</h4>
<p>QUIC's stream multiplexing feature allows multiple streams of data to be transmitted concurrently over a single connection. This capability effectively addresses the Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking issue prevalent in HTTP/1.1 over TCP connections, where the transmission of subsequent requests must wait until the preceding one is fully received. Our findings demonstrate that QUIC-based protocols (h3 and h3-PEP) leverage this feature to achieve faster First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Page Load Time (PLT) in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) orbits, as well as improved PLT in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) orbits, compared to their HTTP/1.1 counterparts (h1 and h1-PEP). The elimination of HoL blocking and efficient management of packet loss through QUIC's advanced loss recovery mechanisms contribute to these performance gains.</p>
<h4>Connection Establishment</h4>
<p>The connection establishment process in QUIC is also optimized compared to traditional TCP. QUIC reduces the time to establish a connection by combining the connection and security handshakes, thus minimizing the number of round trips required to start data transmission. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in satellite communications, where latency is a significant concern due to the long distances involved. Our analysis reveals a notable performance improvement in connection establishment times for h3-PEP over both h3 and the HTTP/1.1-based protocols. Specifically, h3-PEP outperforms h3 by approximately 330ms and surpasses h1 and h1-PEP by more than 3 seconds in GEO orbits. This finding underscores the effectiveness of QUIC's expedited connection establishment in reducing overall latency, further enhanced by the integration of PEP systems.</p>
<h4>Performance in High BDP Networks</h4>
<p>The behavior of Google QUIC (GQUIC) and IETF QUIC (IQUIC) was also examined in the context of high Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) networks characteristic of satellite communications. While GQUIC facilitates quick connection establishment, its performance is hindered by suboptimal congestion control in such environments, leading to significantly increased page download times. This outcome suggests that while QUIC's innovative features offer substantial benefits, specific parameter tuning is necessary for optimal performance in satellite networks. The implementation of a TCP over QUIC tunneling approach further validates QUIC's superiority in maintaining higher throughput in lossy or unstable conditions, albeit with some overhead under ideal network scenarios.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The comparative analysis elucidates the transformative impact of QUIC's multiplexing capabilities and optimized connection establishment on enhancing network performance in satellite communications. These advantages, particularly in reducing latency and improving data throughput, are crucial for the deployment of efficient, high-speed internet services in remote and underserved regions through next-generation satellite networks like Starlink. However, the need for protocol tuning to accommodate the unique characteristics of satellite links emphasizes the importance of continued research and development in this area.</p>
