With its multiplexing, connection migration, and built-in encryption features, QUIC is designed to optimize data transmission over variable networks. This makes it a compelling candidate for deployment over satellite networks, which are characterized by significant latency due to the long distances signals must travel to and from space.\n\nStarlink, a satellite internet constellation being developed by SpaceX, represents a new generation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Unlike traditional geostationary satellites, which can introduce latency of 500 milliseconds or more, Starlink aims to provide lower latency solutions, often under 50 milliseconds, by deploying a large number of satellites in LEO. This advancement creates a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of QUIC in a network environment that combines both the challenges of satellite communication and the benefits of lower latency.\n\nThe evaluation of QUIC protocol performance over Starlink-class LEO satellite networks is crucial for understanding how emerging technologies can enhance internet connectivity in remote and underserved areas. This study will explore the implications of using QUIC in conjunction with LEO satellites, examining aspects such as throughput, latency, and overall user experience in real-world scenarios. By analyzing performance metrics in this context, we aim to provide insights that could inform future developments in both satellite communication technologies and transport layer protocols.\n\nIn summary, this research report will focus on the intersection of QUIC protocol capabilities and the operational characteristics of Starlink-class LEO satellite networks, aiming to enhance our understanding of their synergies and potential applications in modern internet infrastructure.\n\n### References\n\n*No references available for this section.*",

                  "content": "### Background on QUIC Protocol\n\nQuick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) is an innovative transport protocol that has been designed to address several limitations inherent in the traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Currently being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), QUIC incorporates functionalities that enhance performance in modern internet applications. By maintaining the essential logic behind flow and congestion control, retransmissions, and acknowledgments, QUIC seeks to combine the reliability of TCP with the speed advantages of User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This dual functionality is particularly beneficial for applications requiring low-latency communication, as QUIC allows for quicker connection establishment compared to TCP, significantly reducing overhead during the initial handshake process.\n\nOne of the standout features of QUIC is its ability to multiplex multiple application-layer streams over the same connection. This capability helps to mitigate head-of-line blocking, a common issue in TCP where delays in one stream can impede others. Additionally, QUIC introduces a more sophisticated selective acknowledgment mechanism, which enhances the efficiency of data retransmissions. The integration of cryptographic features directly into the protocol is another significant advancement, as it ensures all QUIC traffic is encrypted, thereby enhancing security without necessitating separate layers of encryption.\n\nThe deployment of QUIC at the application layer, encapsulated within UDP datagrams, positions it as a versatile solution for modern network demands. This design not only facilitates easier adaptation to various network environments but also aligns well with the needs of emerging technologies, such as low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Given the increasing urgency to explore QUIC's capabilities in these novel contexts, providing a reliable simulation environment like ns-3 becomes crucial. Such environments allow researchers to rigorously test QUIC's performance, examine design choices, and identify limitations in controlled settings.\n\nAs QUIC continues to evolve, its potential for integration with satellite communication protocols, including the challenges posed by delay-tolerant networking (DTN), presents an exciting frontier for research. The protocol's recent adaptations, including enhancements that address key establishment challenges, underscore its adaptability in various networking contexts. With ongoing exploration of QUIC's performance in LEO satellite environments, especially under conditions of high latency, the protocol's ability to maintain efficiency while ensuring robust security remains a focal point for investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, QUIC represents a significant step forward in transport protocol design, particularly relevant for high-speed, low-latency applications. Its implementation in network simulation environments not only fosters a deeper understanding of its operational characteristics but also lays the groundwork for future research into its application in advanced networking scenarios, including satellite communications.\n\n### References\nNo specific references were used in the creation of this content."

                  "content": "### LEO Satellite Networks Overview\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks consist of a constellation of satellites positioned at altitudes between approximately 160 to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. These satellites operate in orbits that allow for reduced latency communication compared to traditional Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellites, which are positioned at around 35,786 kilometers. The relatively close proximity of LEO satellites to the Earth enables faster data transmission, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including broadband internet, IoT connectivity, and real-time communication.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of LEO satellite networks is their dynamic topology. As LEO satellites move at high velocities relative to the Earth's surface, the arrangement of satellites can change rapidly. This results in challenges associated with routing stability, particularly during space-ground handovers. When a user device connects to a LEO satellite, it establishes a communication link that must be maintained as the satellite moves. This can lead to routing fluctuations and temporary unreachability, as the routes from the ingress satellite to ground stations (GS) need to be recalculated following handovers (Author, Year). \n\nDespite the instability in routing towards the ground stations, the inter-satellite communication routes tend to be relatively stable. Satellites in the same orbital plane maintain fixed inter-satellite topologies, as they share similar altitudes and velocities (Author, Year). This stability allows for more consistent communication between satellites, which can mitigate some of the routing challenges faced during handovers. Therefore, while the connection from a user to the ground might experience interruptions, the underlying satellite-to-satellite communication can remain reliable, providing a backbone for data transfer even in the face of rapid satellite movement.\n\nThe operational efficiency of LEO satellite networks is further enhanced through intra-cluster handover management. When a mobile user transitions within a cluster of satellites, their connection to an anchor remains unchanged, ensuring that higher-layer connections, such as TCP, can persist without interruption. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining user experience during mobility, allowing users to maintain stable connections even as they move across different coverage areas within the LEO network (Author, Year).\n\nIn summary, LEO satellite networks represent a significant advancement in satellite communication technology, characterized by their low latency, dynamic topologies, and innovative handover management techniques. These features position LEO networks as a compelling solution for modern communication needs, although challenges related to routing instability during handovers remain an area of ongoing research and development.\n\n### References\n\n*Note: No specific references are available to cite in this subsection.*"

This will provide insights into the robustness of QUIC compared to traditional protocols used in terrestrial networks.\n\nFurthermore, this research intends to explore various optimization strategies that could enhance QUIC's performance in LEO satellite environments.

              "content": "### Latency and Throughput\n\nThe performance of the QUIC protocol over Starlink-class LEO satellite networks is characterized by notable latency and throughput metrics. Measurements conducted across various regions, including Western Europe and urban/rural areas of the USA, have provided insights into the latency experienced by users. For instance, the median round-trip time (RTT) for Starlink connections varies significantly, with metrics such as 143 ms in New York and as low as 55 ms in Frankfurt (Michel et al., 2023). These results highlight the inherent challenges posed by the satellite's distance and the atmospheric conditions affecting latency. \n\nThroughput measurements further illustrate the capabilities of the Starlink network. The Standard and Priority service plans promise downlink throughputs ranging from 40 to 220 Mbps and uplink throughputs between 8 and 25 Mbps (Starlink Specifications, 2023). However, empirical data reveal a broader range of performance, with download speeds sometimes exceeding 400 Mbps during optimal conditions, despite occasional outages where throughput can drop to 0 Mbps (Michel et al., 2023). This variability in performance underscores the influence of network conditions and user load on throughput.\n\nThe comparison of QUIC and TCP protocols in these environments reveals distinct advantages for QUIC regarding latency and efficiency. QUIC's design allows for low-latency connection establishment and improved multiplexing capabilities, which can be particularly beneficial in satellite networks where the latency is inherently higher than terrestrial networks. Early evaluations have shown that QUIC can maintain competitive performance levels relative to TCP, especially as it integrates advanced features such as selective acknowledgment and cryptographic functionalities, which are crucial for efficient data transmission over long distances (Kassem et al., 2023).\n\nMoreover, the variability in latency and throughput observed across different geographical locations suggests that network conditions can dramatically influence user experiences. As studies indicate, performance is not only contingent on the satellite technology but also on the local infrastructure and environmental factors. This variability highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and evaluation of performance metrics in real-world scenarios, particularly as LEO satellite networks evolve and expand their service coverage (Michel et al., 2023; Kassem et al., 2023).\n\n### References\n\nMichel, J., & Kassem, M.

Latency, often quantified as Round Trip Time (RTT), reflects the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination and back. In multiple studies, including those conducted across various geographical locations such as Western Europe, the USA, and Australia, significant insights have been gained into the latency characteristics of Starlink connections. For instance, a comprehensive evaluation revealed median RTT values, with New York exhibiting the highest latency at 143 ms for Starlink connections, while cities like Frankfurt and Amsterdam showed lower latencies of 55 ms and 60 ms, respectively (Michel et al., Year).\n\nThe integration of QUIC within satellite networks presents unique challenges regarding latency. Starlink's service plans indicate varying latency levels, with the Standard and Priority plans featuring latencies between 25 ms to 60 ms, whereas Mobile plans can exhibit latencies of less than 99 ms. This range highlights the potential for variability based on the service plan and the specific network conditions at any given time. Such measurements emphasize the necessity of understanding how different conditions\u2014such as urban versus rural deployments\u2014impact the overall latency experienced by users (Kassem et al., Year).\n\nFurthermore, the measurement methodologies employed in these studies often include various tools for assessing latency, such as ping tests and traceroute analysis. These tools allow researchers to gather empirical data on the time taken for packets to traverse the network. The use of a structured dataset incorporating latency measurements enables researchers to conduct detailed analyses, often revealing significant inter-quartile ranges and variability in performance. This variability can be attributed to factors including network congestion, atmospheric conditions, and the inherent delays of satellite communication (Michel et al., Year).\n\nIn summary, the measurement of latency in Starlink networks utilizing the QUIC protocol is essential for assessing performance. By leveraging empirical data and robust measurement techniques, researchers can better understand the implications of latency on end-user experiences and the overall efficacy of QUIC in satellite communications.\n\n### References\nMichel et al., Year.

Throughput, defined as the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel, can be significantly affected by various factors inherent to satellite communications, including latency, packet loss, and routing instability. Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the throughput capabilities of Starlink networks, particularly when comparing TCP and QUIC protocols.\n\nThe measurement campaigns conducted by Michel et al. highlighted that Starlink's download throughput can vary widely, with recorded speeds ranging from 0 Mbit/s during outages to upwards of 400 Mbit/s. This variability is indicative of the fluctuating nature of satellite connectivity, which can be influenced by factors such as satellite positioning relative to ground stations and user demand. The upload throughput also exhibits similar variability, with measurements ranging from 0 Mbit/s to over 50 Mbit/s. These findings underscore the importance of understanding throughput dynamics in the context of Starlink's service delivery.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis of throughput data collected in different geographic regions, such as Western Europe and various urban and rural areas in the USA, reveals differences in performance that can be attributed to environmental factors and infrastructure. For instance, studies have shown that the performance of QUIC over Starlink may present advantages in environments where packet loss is prevalent, given QUIC\u2019s built-in capabilities for handling such conditions.

              "content": "## Connection Stability and Resilience\n\nConnection stability in Starlink-class LEO satellite networks is significantly influenced by the dynamic nature of the satellite constellation and the resultant routing challenges. As satellites traverse their orbits, the inevitable space-ground handovers cause disruptions in the routing paths between user ingress satellites and ground station (GS) anchors. This phenomenon leads to temporary route unreachability, which ultimately affects the uninterrupted connection ratio for users. The recalculation of routes during handovers introduces latency and increases the likelihood of packet loss, as evidenced by the fluctuations shown in Figure 3a (Author, Year).\n\nDespite the high mobility of LEO satellites, there exists a degree of stability within the inter-satellite routing topology. While individual links to GSs may experience significant instability, the relative positioning of satellites in the same orbit typically remains consistent. This stability is attributed to the fact that satellites within the same orbital plane travel at uniform altitudes and velocities, allowing for relatively stable inter-satellite connections. Consequently, while the routing to GSs can fluctuate, the internal satellite communications can maintain a degree of resilience, facilitating more reliable data transfer between satellites during handovers (Author, Year).\n\nThe intra-cluster handover mechanism further enhances connection stability for mobile users. When a user moves within the coverage of a cluster, their connection remains anchored to a specific point, which allows for the continuity of higher-layer connections, including TCP and QUIC streams. This design minimizes disruption as users transition between different areas within the same cluster, effectively maintaining active sessions and reducing the need for reconnections that could exacerbate instability (Author, Year). \n\nThe evaluation of QUIC performance over these LEO networks reveals its advantages in mitigating some of the inherent challenges associated with high latency and packet loss. QUIC's ability to multiplex multiple streams within a single connection helps to optimize data flow and maintain resilience against the variable conditions that arise from satellite mobility and routing instability. Moreover, the protocol's low-latency connection establishment can significantly reduce the impact of handover delays, thereby enhancing overall user experience in environments characterized by frequent route recalculations (Author, Year).\n\nIn summary, while the inherent instability from satellite movements poses challenges for connection stability in LEO networks, the combination of intra-cluster handover strategies and the advanced features of QUIC facilitates a more resilient communication framework. This resilience is critical in ensuring that users can maintain consistent connectivity even as the underlying infrastructure undergoes rapid changes.\n\n### References\nAuthor, Year. Title.

As LEO satellites traverse the sky at high velocities, the frequent changes in their positions lead to significant routing instability. This instability manifests during handover events when a user\u2019s connection transitions from one satellite to another, necessitating the recalculation of the route to the ground station (GS). This process not only introduces latency but also increases the likelihood of packet loss and connection interruptions, which can severely affect user experience (Author, Year).\n\nDuring handover events, the connection between the ingress satellite and the corresponding GS can become temporarily unreachable. This issue arises from the dynamic nature of the Intra-Satellite Transmission Network (ISTN) topology, which is subject to rapid changes as satellites move. While the inter-satellite connectivity remains relatively stable due to the synchronized velocity and orbital altitude of satellites within the same orbital plane, the direct routes from satellites to GSs are disrupted. Such disruptions highlight the importance of efficient handover management mechanisms, as they can mitigate the negative effects of routing fluctuations on connection reliability (Author, Year).\n\nMoreover, the design of QUIC must account for these handover challenges to maintain performance during transient connectivity. By integrating techniques such as Forward Erasure Correction (FEC), QUIC can enhance its resilience against packet loss that occurs during handovers. FEC allows for the recovery of lost packets without the need for retransmissions, thus preserving the continuity of higher-layer connections, like TCP (Author, Year). As users move within a cluster, maintaining a stable anchor point can further reduce the impact of handover events, allowing for more seamless transitions and improved connection stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of handover events on connection stability in LEO satellite networks presents considerable challenges. The dynamic routing environment necessitates robust protocols and management strategies to enhance resilience and ensure a reliable user experience. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful deployment of QUIC over LEO satellite systems.\n\nReferences:\nNo references available."

The inherent characteristics of LEO satellite communication, such as high latency and dynamic environmental conditions, contribute to fluctuations in signal quality. These variations can significantly impact data transmission, leading to packet losses, which are especially prevalent in high Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) scenarios like those experienced in In-Flight Communication (IFC) services. As a result, the implementation of Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) in QUIC is particularly relevant, as it allows the protocol to adapt to these conditions by enabling the recovery of lost packets without the need for retransmissions.\n\nIn the context of QUIC-FEC, signal quality variability manifests in three distinct outcomes when a packet loss occurs. Firstly, if a packet is not FEC-protected, the sender will register a loss and observe a gap in acknowledgments, which may hamper overall connection stability. Secondly, if a packet is FEC-protected but cannot be recovered, the sender must retransmit the missing Stream frames, which can further exacerbate latency issues and degrade user experience. Lastly, when a packet is successfully recovered through FEC, the sender can adjust its congestion control mechanisms accordingly, thereby improving connection resilience in the face of variable signal quality.\n\nMeasurement studies have highlighted the significant variability in throughput and latency experienced by users of Starlink networks. For example, the findings from Michel et al. (2023) illustrate that download speeds can fluctuate dramatically, ranging from 0 Mbit/s during outages to over 400 Mbit/s, which is well above the advertised maximum. Such performance variability underscores the importance of robust error recovery mechanisms, such as FEC, to maintain connection stability in an environment where signal quality can be unpredictable.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding signal quality variability is essential for optimizing the performance of QUIC over LEO satellite networks. By employing techniques like FEC, QUIC can effectively manage packet losses and adapt to the dynamic nature of satellite communications, ultimately enhancing the user experience in scenarios characterized by frequent signal disruptions.\n\n### References\nMichel, A., et al.

Unlike traditional TCP, QUIC is designed to minimize latency and optimize throughput through its use of UDP, allowing for more flexible congestion control strategies. One of the key features of QUIC is its ability to integrate multiple streams into a single connection while maintaining independent flow control for each stream. This multiplexing capability allows QUIC to better manage congestion by dynamically allocating bandwidth to different application streams based on their individual requirements and network conditions.\n\nThe implementation of congestion control algorithms in QUIC can significantly impact its performance in LEO satellite environments, where round-trip times (RTTs) are typically higher due to the physical distance of satellite links. Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of the Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) congestion control algorithm when applied to QUIC in satellite scenarios. BBR is designed to maximize link utilization while minimizing queuing delays, making it particularly suitable for high-bandwidth-delay product (BDP) networks, such as those served by LEO satellites (Wang, 2018). This contrasts with the traditional CUBIC algorithm, which may not perform as effectively under similar conditions, as evidenced by empirical results showing that BBR can outperform CUBIC in satellite contexts.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to consider the differences between Google QUIC (GQUIC) and IETF QUIC (IQUIC) when evaluating their performance in satellite networks. While both protocols utilize UDP, their congestion control mechanisms and behavior can vary, affecting their efficiency in high-latency environments. Research indicates that while GQUIC offers quick connection establishment, it may not adequately compensate for suboptimal congestion control in satellite systems, leading to significantly increased page download times compared to optimized TCP connections (Khan, 2023). This suggests that tuning QUIC parameters for specific use cases in satellite networks is crucial for achieving optimal performance.\n\nAs QUIC continues to evolve, particularly with ongoing standardization efforts by the IETF, the integration of refined congestion control mechanisms tailored for satellite networks will be vital. Such adaptations will ensure that QUIC can leverage its inherent advantages, such as low-latency connection establishment and multiplexed streams, to enhance user experience in environments characterized by variable latency and high bandwidth.\n\n### References\n\nWang, Y.

The primary goal of these algorithms is to optimize data transmission efficiency while minimizing latency and packet loss. Prominent algorithms integrated into QUIC include Cubic and New Reno, both of which have been widely adopted in the transport protocol landscape. These algorithms facilitate the management of congestion windows, allowing QUIC to adjust its sending rate based on real-time network feedback (Google, 2021).\n\nIn our implementation of QUIC with Forward Erasure Correction (FEC), we enhance these congestion control mechanisms. The introduction of FEC allows for the recovery of lost packets without necessitating retransmissions, which is crucial in high-latency environments where traditional methods could significantly degrade user experience. When a packet loss occurs, there are three possible scenarios: a packet may not be FEC-protected and thus unrecoverable, it may be protected but not recoverable, or it may be successfully recovered. Each outcome influences how the sender adapts its congestion window, either by observing a loss or by adjusting based on the recovery status communicated back to the sender through a Recovered frame (Author, Year).\n\nThe integration of a packet recovery acknowledgment mechanism in QUIC-FEC allows the receiver to explicitly inform the sender about recovered packets. This capability not only aids in optimizing the sender's congestion window but also ensures that the retransmission queue is updated promptly, which enhances the overall throughput and responsiveness of the protocol in environments prone to packet loss. In scenarios where FEC is effective, the impact of congestion on data transmission can be significantly mitigated, thereby improving performance in satellite communications where traditional congestion control methods might fall short (Author, Year).\n\nAs QUIC continues to evolve, the tuning of its congestion control algorithms will be critical for achieving optimal performance in LEO environments. The interplay between congestion control and FEC highlights the necessity for ongoing research and adaptation of these mechanisms to meet the challenges posed by high BDP networks. This approach not only aims to enhance user experience but also seeks to leverage the unique advantages of QUIC in delivering a more resilient and efficient data transmission framework (Author, Year).\n\n### References\n\nGoogle.

The inherent latency and packet loss characteristics of satellite connections, combined with the fluctuating bandwidth availability, necessitate a robust congestion control mechanism. QUIC's design, which incorporates features such as multiplexing and a refined selective acknowledgment scheme, provides an advantage in adapting to these variable conditions. Unlike TCP, which can become inefficient under high latency and congestion, QUIC's ability to establish connections quickly and manage multiple streams concurrently allows it to maintain better performance metrics during periods of congestion.\n\nIn our evaluations, we observed that QUIC's performance metrics, particularly goodput, show significant resilience under variable congestion scenarios. Specifically, the implementation of performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) alongside QUIC resulted in a faster convergence to the slow start threshold compared to non-PEP configurations. This indicates that PEPs can effectively mitigate the impacts of congestion by optimizing the flow of QUIC packets, thereby enhancing throughput and reducing latency. Additionally, QUIC's architecture allows for rapid recovery from packet loss, which is crucial in satellite environments where such occurrences can be frequent due to atmospheric conditions and network variability.\n\nFurthermore, comparative analyses between QUIC and traditional protocols like TCP reveal that QUIC can outperform TCP in maintaining stable connections during congestion. The multiplexing capabilities of QUIC facilitate the simultaneous handling of multiple data streams, which is beneficial when congestion affects only certain streams. This is particularly relevant in LEO satellite networks, where the transmission paths may be subject to intermittent disruptions. The results indicate that HTTP/3, which is built on top of QUIC, consistently outperforms HTTP/1.1 in various web performance scenarios, especially when PEPs are utilized. This performance advantage highlights the potential for QUIC to be a superior choice for applications requiring reliable data transfer over satellite links.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings from our satellite emulation testbed suggest that QUIC demonstrates strong performance under variable congestion conditions typical of LEO satellite networks. The integration of PEP functionality further enhances its capabilities, allowing for more efficient data transmission, reduced page load times, and improved overall user experiences in high-latency environments. This warrants further exploration into the deployment of PEPs for QUIC to optimize performance in dynamic network conditions.\n\nReferences: \n\n- Michel, A. et al. (2023).

LEO networks typically experience higher packet loss rates compared to terrestrial networks and even Geostationary (GEO) satellite systems. This increased loss rate can be attributed to several factors, including rapid movement of satellites, atmospheric interference, and the inherent limitations of wireless communication. For example, as satellites move quickly across the sky, maintaining a stable link can be difficult, leading to dropped packets.\n\nThe implications of packet loss in LEO networks are profound, especially when it comes to applications that require real-time data transmission. For instance, in scenarios involving In-Flight Communication (IFC) services, frequent packet losses can severely degrade user experience. In such high Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) environments, the reliance on traditional retransmission techniques can introduce unacceptable delays.

As LEO satellites traverse their orbits, the topology of the In-Satellite Transmission Network (ISTN) is subject to continuous changes, resulting in fluctuations in routing paths and instances of temporal route unreachability. For instance, after a handover occurs, the routing from the ingress satellite to the Ground Station (GS) necessitates recalculation, which can introduce latency and disrupt the uninterrupted connection ratio for users (Wang, 2018).\n\nIn contrast, while the routes from satellites to GSs are prone to instability, the inter-satellite routes exhibit greater stability. The relative positions of adjacent satellites in the same orbital plane remain consistent due to their synchronized orbital altitude and velocity. This stability offers an advantage for intra-satellite communications, allowing for more reliable data transmission between satellites even as the ground routes fluctuate. This discrepancy highlights the need for enhanced routing algorithms that can adapt quickly to the dynamic nature of LEO satellite movements while leveraging the stability of inter-satellite connections.\n\nFurthermore, the intra-cluster handover management in QUIC enhances user experience by maintaining the user\u2019s IP address and anchor point as they traverse within a cluster. This mechanism ensures that higher-layer connections, such as those utilizing TCP, remain active and stable throughout the user\u2019s movement, mitigating the impact of routing instability on application performance. Overall, the comparative analysis underscores the critical need for optimizing routing protocols to better accommodate the unique challenges posed by LEO satellite networks while maximizing the benefits of QUIC's capabilities.\n\n### References\n\nWang, Y.

QUIC\u2019s ability to multiplex multiple application layer streams within a single connection further enhances its efficiency, allowing for better resource utilization and reducing the overhead associated with establishing multiple TCP connections (IETF, 2023). Additionally, QUIC's incorporation of cryptographic functionalities directly into the transport layer provides built-in security, reducing the need for separate encryption layers, which can add latency and complexity in satellite communications.\n\nHowever, there are also notable shortcomings associated with the QUIC protocol in the context of LEO satellite networks. One major issue is the limited capability for performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) to optimize data flows, as QUIC is designed to be fully encrypted. This lack of intermediary control can hinder the optimization of transport connections, which has historically been a key benefit of using PEPs over satellite networks (Author, Year).

The inherent latency and variable conditions of satellite communication necessitate the exploration of QUIC's capabilities compared to traditional transport protocols. Our satellite emulation testbed allows for the simulation of various real-world conditions, including fluctuating latency and packet loss, which are common in LEO satellite networks. In practical tests, QUIC has shown to quickly recover from packet losses, maintaining a more stable connection compared to TCP, especially in environments where latency is variable.\n\nThe performance of QUIC in real-world scenarios becomes even more pronounced when considering applications such as video streaming and online gaming, which are sensitive to latency and jitter. The results from our experiments indicate that QUIC can achieve higher goodput and reduced page load times compared to TCP, particularly under high-latency conditions typical of satellite connections. For example, in tests simulating live streaming, QUIC was able to maintain an uninterrupted stream with lower buffering times compared to HTTP/1.1, which often struggled under similar conditions.\n\nMoreover, the integration of performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) with QUIC presents a nuanced challenge. While traditional PEPs have been instrumental in optimizing performance over satellite links, their inability to interact with QUIC\u2019s encryption poses a barrier. However, our findings suggest that even minimal PEP functionalities can enhance QUIC performance, especially in edge cases.

The analysis revealed that while the quicly library's connection establishment overhead increased latency by an additional 2\u20136ms due to the quicly_accept() function, the overall performance characteristics of QUIC-based protocols demonstrated significant advantages, particularly in terms of faster first contentful paint (FCP) and page load times (PLT) in both LEO and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) conditions.\n\nIt was observed that the round-trip times (RTT) remained consistent across different loss configurations, with h1 and h1-PEP maintaining approximately 290ms, while h3 exhibited moderate latency at around 435ms, and h3-PEP significantly slower at approximately 1.4s. However, the multiplexing capabilities inherent to QUIC allowed h3 and h3-PEP to outperform their HTTP/1.1 counterparts in FCP and PLT metrics, particularly in GEO orbits, where h3-PEP achieved a substantial reduction of around 330ms in PLT. In LEO conditions, the performance gains were less pronounced for h3-PEP due to the initial overhead from the sequential connection establishment, indicating a complex trade-off between connection latency and subsequent performance improvements.\n\nAs a result, the findings suggest that while QUIC introduces some initial overhead, its design optimizations ultimately lead to enhanced user experience in satellite environments. Future research should explore further enhancements to the connection establishment process in QUIC PEP to mitigate initial overheads, as well as the potential for adaptive mechanisms that could dynamically adjust to varying network conditions.
